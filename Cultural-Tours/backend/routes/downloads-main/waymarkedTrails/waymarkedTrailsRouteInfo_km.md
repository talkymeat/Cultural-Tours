# Waymarked Trails

- The benefit of using these known waymarked trails is that they have reasonable signage and following them for the user will be easier.
- Quiet routes and Regional routes are complete routes.
- For longer routes (NCN and JMW) start and end points are given.
- Note these endpoints files contain two (or perhaps 3) close together GPS positions since that was only way I could easily find to dump out GPX files. Either point is fine to use as a start/end.
